# YOLOv8-Driven-Aircraft-Detection-in-Dynamic-Environments

This project implements a real-time aircraft detection system using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. Leveraging machine learning, the model is trained to accurately identify aircraft in various environments, making it ideal for applications such as air traffic monitoring, aviation security, and aerial imagery analysis. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, along with visualization of detection results. The goal is to provide a robust, efficient solution for detecting aircraft in complex settings.

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and results!
