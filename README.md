# YOLOv8-Driven-Aircraft-Detection-in-Dynamic-Environments

This project implements a real-time aircraft detection system using **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. Leveraging machine learning, the model is trained to accurately identify aircraft in various environments, making it ideal for applications such as:

- Air traffic monitoring
- Aviation security
- Aerial imagery analysis

The project includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, along with visualization of detection results. The goal is to provide a robust, efficient solution for detecting aircraft in complex settings.

## **Features**

- Real-time aircraft detection using YOLOv8
- Robust model suitable for various aviation-related applications
- End-to-end process: data preprocessing, model training, and result visualization

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/aircraft-detection-yolov8.git
